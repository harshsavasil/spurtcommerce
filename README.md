# ❯ Why did we develop Spurtcommerce? 

eCommerce solutions are certainly not new in the industry. From over a past decade, several eCommerce solutions have been there. Also, most of them are open source and have a good supporting community as well. However, they are all built on PHP technology. 

Spurtcommerce is one among the very few NodeJS and Angular eCommerce solutions. Again, there are others built on NodeJS, however, Spurtcommerce is the first among the NodeJS and Angular eCommerce solutions with a supporting Community. 

Further, NodeJS has certain advantages over PHP, in terms of speed, scalability, security and performance. Further, Spurtcommerce has been developed using the highest coding standards in the industry. Spurtcommerce is not a framework and it comes with complete Source Code that can be tweaked,forked and modified for any requirement. 

Having inspired by the smartness of NodeJS and Angular, in creating high performing and highly scalable applications, and also being the biggest fanatics of Open Source technologies, the team behind the innovation of Spurtcommerce got encouraged to develop this solution, to offer a smart eCommerce solution to the Developers' Community.
